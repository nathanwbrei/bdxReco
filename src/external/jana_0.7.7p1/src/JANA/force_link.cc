// This file is an unfortunate work-around for a very annoying feature
// in gcc 4.1 linking behavior. The problem is basically this:
//
// Not all symbols from libJANA.a are included in exectuables linked
// with it. Specifically, I had problems with the jana executable
// not including the JEventSource default destructor which is needed
// by the TestSpeed plugin. This is a problem
// for plugins which expect to get all of the JANA routines through
// the executable. One alternative is to link the plugin with libJANA.a
// but that also causes problems in that multiple jout and jerr
// globals are present which (mysteriously) results in a seg. fault
// near program termination iff a plugin is attached. Another solution
// is to use the -rdynamic flag which causes all GLOBAL symbols to
// automatically be exported. Unfortunately, on CentOS5.3 at least,
// many things (like the JEventSource default destructor) are marked
// as "weak" symbols rather than "global" so they don't get exported
// despite the -rdynamic flag.
//
// So this brings us to this very ugly business. This file exists 
// solely to provide code that forces the symbols to be brought in.
// The force_links routine is called from the JApplication constructor,
// but only when narg<0 which never happens. It is enough though to
// force the linker to include these however.
